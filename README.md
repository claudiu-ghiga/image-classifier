# image-classifier

Content-based image recognition using grey-level co-occurence matrices. After features are extracted from the matrices, test instances are compared using a simple nearest neighbor procedure. The distance between feature vectors is given by a p-norm, where p is a parameter of the algorithm.

Requires Eigen 3.3.8 and OpenCV 4.5.3.
